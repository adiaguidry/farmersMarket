# ONLINE FARMERS MARKET PROJECT


## Overview
This project was built with React JS with a Redux store to manage the state. The backend rest api was built with Node JS, Express, Mongoose with a Mongo database. The App pulls local farmers information to allow users to select a farm and produce of their choice. This app pulls in MapBox's API to pin point the farm locations on a map. Users selects a farmer and create a produce box with a drag and drop option.
